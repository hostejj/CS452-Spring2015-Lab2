For my solution to this problem the simple shape I chose to draw is a star. I set the color
in my fragment shader to a uniform variable that I could change in my program. To get the
three different colors I drew the star in three separate parts setting each part to a different 
color. To accept keyboard I used the window.onkeydown to read in a key and used a switch statement
to determine what action to take if any. When the '1' key is pressed I simply rerender the initial
object. When a key is pressed to move the shape I alter the location of the vertices of the shape
by a small delta value. Then I reload the data into a buffer and rerender the shape.
